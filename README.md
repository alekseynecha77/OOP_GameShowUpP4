# OOP_GameShowUpP4

This is a browser based word guessing game

It is uses JavaScript with a OOP approach to select a random hidden phrase which a player tries to guess by clicking on the onscreen keyboard or their physical keyboard

It uses two classes Game and Phrase.

The Game class is used to manage the game while the Phrase class deals with the phrase randomly selected

Regarding style, I added specific gifs of whether user won or lose a game

I also changed a few things about the styling of the game, they include:


* Keyboard buttons transition and colour when they are pressed

* The initial starting overlay background gif image 

* different color for title

* The color and way letters from the phrase get revealed
